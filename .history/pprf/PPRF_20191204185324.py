    This class models a PuncturablePseudoRandomFunction. A PPRF is a normal function F: X->Y. But,
    one can make it unevaluatable for a certain value without affecting any other value. It basically
    implements the PPRF as introduced in 'Session Resumption Protocols and Efficient Forward Security
    for TLS 1.3 0-RTT' The research group around Tibor Jager created a C implementation in OpenSSL of
    this to show its practical fuctionality. This is a much simpler python implementation of such a 
    function for any purpose.

    The PPRF offers three functions:

    setup(secpem): Initializes the function with a certain security parameter which will define the 
        'grade of security' of the function. As of end of 2019, 4096 is recommended. In practice this
        function will be the constructor.
    
    evaluate(x): Evaluates the PPRF on value x, iff x is a member of X. Meaning, if will only evaluate it
        for valid x. Furthermore, the PPRF will not return a results if the value x has been punctured.

    puncture(x): Punctures the PPRF on value x. That means that the evaluate(x) will not be able to return a
        result anymore. Even more so, should all data about the PPRF be leaked no one can find te result of
        evaluate(x) in acceptable time regarding to the security parameter.
