# De-Discord-Algos
Contains different kinds of algorithms in different kinds of languages that have been written in relation to the /r/de-Discord Server.

# Guidelines
The structure is supposed to be simple. One folder for one category of algorithms (e.g. Sorting Algorithms, MathTools) and one file for one algorithm. Smaller algorithms as many small math functions can go into the same file. Just be reasonable about balancing file size against file amount. This structuring is done to manage different languages more efficiently.

Try to write in English. Even though the discord is non-english speaking we would like the algorithms to be resuable in other projects.
