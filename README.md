# De-Discord-Algos
Contains different kinds of algorithms in different kinds of languages that have been written in relation to the /r/de-Discord Server.

# Guidelines
The structure is supposed to be simple. One Folder for every language with sub-folders for different topics (e.g. Sorting Algorithms, mathetmatical functions). In genereal, one algorithm in one file is preferred.

Try to write in English. Even though the discord is non-english speaking we would like the algorithms to be resuable in other projects.
